          , a weekly publication edited by erstwhile Q editor Ted
          Kessler and staff members Chris Catchpole and Niall Doherty, launches
          on 26 February with new interviews from artists including St Vincent,
          Arlo Parks and Tony Visconti, along with playlists and
          recommendations.

          The New Cue is distributed via Substack. Launched in 2018, the
          platform allows authors to send free and paid email newsletter
          subscriptions and has attracted a number of

          Kessler described the New Cue as “an evolution” of the final years of
          the Bauer Media title Q, when he was working “without editorial
          interference”, and particularly the last few months of its existence.
          “We had very little to work with, so we were more imaginative and I
          found that creatively satisfying, even in quite a stressful period.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Readers could expect “snappy Q&A interviews and inspiring
          recommendations”, said Kessler. “I want lots of short sections that
          sparkle from a bigger thing that I can return to, rather than one long
          continuous read. There’s a massive bear trap that people fall into
          whereby, because there’s no limit to what length you can write in a
          newsletter or online, people go super long. It’s not the New Yorker.”

          Bauer Media put Q magazine under review in May 2020 and shuttered it
          two months later. “The pandemic and lockdown has further accelerated
          the trends already affecting the publishing industry,” Chris Duncan,
          the company’s chief executive of UK publishing, said at the time. Its
          circulation had dwindled to 28,359, with less than half of that coming
          from newsstand sales, compared with a peak of more than 200,000 in
          2001.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q had been a “very lean operation” in its final years and was on
          course to hit newsstand sales and festival partnerships necessary for
          survival in February 2020, said Kessler. “But the lockdown wiped away
          all of that. I didn’t have any proposals for Q. I saw the numbers.
          Bauer did their best – no hard feelings.”

          Many music magazines 
          <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/24/like-a-tap-
          being-turned-off-music-magazines-in-uk-fight-for-survival-covid-19">
            have struggled during the coronavirus pandemic
          </a>
          , with some launching support schemes to attract new readers and shore
          up their survival. Loud & Quiet and Crack magazine recently returned
          to print after Covid-induced stints as digital publications, buoyed by
          successful subscription drives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first few editions of the New Cue would be free, said Kessler,
          followed by a monthly subscription fee of £5 or an annual rate of £55
          with occasional free weeks. More than 1,200 readers had signed up in
          the weeks prior to launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kessler said he didn’t expect newsletters to supplant traditional
          music media – and hoped they wouldn’t, as a paying subscriber to many
          print publications. The bigger threat to their survival was the free
          publishing model, he said. “I believe you should pay for what you
          consume, by and large, if it’s made with skill, sweat and love. Charge
          people and then you protect the wider industry.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The months since Q’s demise had shown Kessler the challenges of the
          “high-quality but totally saturated” freelance market. “When I think
          of the brilliant Q writers who lost that regular work, I feel sick,”
          he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          As much as providing a new music publication, the New Cue was about
          “collaboration, being part of a team, getting a rhythm going on a
          publication”, said Kessler. “I’m really just doing the New Cue so we
          can all have fun working together and celebrate with a pint after work
          again. I hope that comes across in the newsletters.”

            to ask. Tens of millions have placed their trust in the Guardian’s
            high-impact journalism since we started publishing 200 years ago,
            turning to us in moments of crisis, uncertainty, solidarity and
            hope. More than 1.5 million readers, from 180 countries, have
            recently taken the step to support us financially – keeping us open
            to all, and fiercely independent.

            With no shareholders or billionaire owner, we can set our own agenda
            and provide trustworthy journalism that’s free from commercial and
            political influence, offering a counterweight to the spread of
            misinformation. When it’s never mattered more, we can investigate
            and challenge without fear or favour.

            Unlike many others, Guardian journalism is available for everyone to
            read, regardless of what they can afford to pay. We do this because
            we believe in information equality. Greater numbers of people can

            communities, and become inspired to take meaningful action.

          <p>
            We aim to offer readers a comprehensive, international perspective
            on critical events shaping our world – from the Black Lives Matter
            movement, to the new American administration, Brexit, and the
            world's slow emergence from a global pandemic. We are committed to
            upholding our reputation for urgent, powerful reporting on the
            climate emergency, and made the decision to reject advertising from
            fossil fuel companies, divest from the oil and gas industries, and
            set a course to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.
