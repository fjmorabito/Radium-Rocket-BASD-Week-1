          A seemingly unusual jump in tractor sales in Punjab and Haryana during
          November 2020-January 2021 has been cited by the Delhi Police as proof
          of a “

              well-orchestrated conspiracy
            </a>
          </strong>
          ” behind the protests against the Centre’s three farm laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Delhi Police has pointed out that tractor sales growth,
          year-on-year, in Punjab were 43.53 per cent in November, 94.30 per
          cent in December and 85.13 per cent in January, while in Haryana, the
          growth figures stood at 31.81 per cent, 50.32 per cent and 48 per cent
          for the same months.
        </p>
        <p>
          But data from the Tractor and Mechanisation Association (TMA), whose
          figures the Delhi Police has cited, also show a similar high
          year-on-year sales growth trend across India — at 51.25 per cent in
          November, 43.09 per cent in December and 46.75 per cent in January.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is more, the spurt in sales started in May 2020 (before the farm
          protests took off) and continued right till April this year (well past
          the peak of the protests in November to February).

            Red Fort violence: Delhi Police sees a conspiracy in rise of tractor
            sales
          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          That the high tractor sales growth has little to do with the anti-farm
          laws agitation is also borne out by the fact that Punjab and Haryana
          account for barely 7 per cent of all-India tractor sales. Out of the
          total 8.8 lakh units sold during 2019-20, Punjab’s share was just
          21,399 and Haryana’s at 38,705. These were well behind Uttar Pradesh
          (1.21 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (87,621), Rajasthan (68,563), Maharashtra
          (61,871), Gujarat (55,411) and Bihar (43,246).
        </p>
        <img src="./Assets/images/tractor-data.jpg" />
        <p>
          The reason for the higher growth, in percentage terms, in tractor
          sales in Punjab and Haryana during December 2020 and January 2021, is
          the low base in the corresponding months of the financial year 2019-20
          for both states. In absolute terms, the sale of tractors increased by
          only 745 in Punjab and 774 in Haryana against the all-India increase
          of 18,443 during December 2020. In January 2021, too, the absolute
          increase in tractor sales in Punjab and Haryana was just 1,306 and
          1,265 against an all-India increase of 24,958.

            <p>
              Even during the three “conspiracy” months of November 2020-January
              2021, the total tractor sales of Punjab and Haryana, at 15,670,
              were only 7 per cent of the corresponding all-India figure of
              2,21,924 for the same period.
            </p>
            <p>
              What then explains the spike in tractor sales, on a pan-India
              basis, from last June? There are three likely reasons.

            NHRC notices to four govts, police chiefs over ‘adverse impact’ of
            farmers’ protests
          </a>

        <p>
          The first is the good monsoons that produced back-to-back bumper
          harvests during the rabi 2020 season (April-June), kharif 2020
          (October-December) and rabi 2021 (April-June). In fact, Agriculture,
          Fishing and Forestry was the only sector that achieved a positive
          growth rate of 3.6% in financial year 2020-21.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second possible reason for the high tractor sales is that all
          agriculture-related activities were exempted from government lockdown
          restrictions, both in the first and second wave of Covid-19. Farmers
          could, therefore, take advantage of the excellent monsoon rains to
          both produce as well as harvest their record foodgrain and other
          crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third was government procurement. During the post-lockdown period,
          government agencies bought record/massive quantities of not just wheat
          and paddy, but also cotton, rapeseed-mustard and pulses.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, around 433.44 lakh metric tonnes wheat was procured for
          rabi marketing season 2021-22, against 389.93 LMT being procured in
          the previous year, benefiting about 49.20 lakh farmers.

          All these three factors resulted in higher farm incomes and it is
          likely that the money earned was spent, among other things, on buying
          tractors. And this happened not only in Punjab and Haryana, but also
          other states where there have hardly been any farmer protests.

          The TMA data show that after registering a decline in the months of
          March and April in 2020, the sales of tractors picked up from May last
          year, when 60,441 tractors were sold – 4.05% higher than 58,091 in the
          same month of 2019. The growth in tractor sales across the country
          continued till April this year when it recorded a whopping 436.25%
          increase – 63,422 in April this year over a low base of 11,827 in the
          same month last year. However, in May this year, sales declined by
          7.99 per cent. In the following two months, June (18.85 per cent) and
          July (3.25 per cent), the growth remained positive but in August
          (-17.01 per cent), it again entered into the negative territory.
