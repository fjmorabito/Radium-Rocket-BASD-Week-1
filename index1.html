              A seemingly unusual jump in tractor sales in Punjab and Haryana

              ” behind the protests against the Centre’s three farm laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Delhi Police has pointed out that tractor sales growth,
              year-on-year, in Punjab were 43.53 per cent in November, 94.30 per
              cent in December and 85.13 per cent in January, while in Haryana,
              the growth figures stood at 31.81 per cent, 50.32 per cent and 48
              per cent for the same months.
            </p>
            <p>
              But data from the Tractor and Mechanisation Association (TMA),
              whose figures the Delhi Police has cited, also show a similar high
              year-on-year sales growth trend across India — at 51.25 per cent
              in November, 43.09 per cent in December and 46.75 per cent in
              January.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is more, the spurt in sales started in May 2020 (before the
              farm protests took off) and continued right till April this year
              (well past the peak of the protests in November to February).

                Red Fort violence: Delhi Police sees a conspiracy in rise of
                tractor sales
              </a>
            </div>
            <p>
              That the high tractor sales growth has little to do with the
              anti-farm laws agitation is also borne out by the fact that Punjab
              and Haryana account for barely 7 per cent of all-India tractor
              sales. Out of the total 8.8 lakh units sold during 2019-20,
              Punjab’s share was just 21,399 and Haryana’s at 38,705. These were
              well behind Uttar Pradesh (1.21 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (87,621),
              Rajasthan (68,563), Maharashtra (61,871), Gujarat (55,411) and
              Bihar (43,246).
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/images/tractor-data.jpg" class="article-img" />
            <p>
              The reason for the higher growth, in percentage terms, in tractor
              sales in Punjab and Haryana during December 2020 and January 2021,
              is the low base in the corresponding months of the financial year
              2019-20 for both states. In absolute terms, the sale of tractors
              increased by only 745 in Punjab and 774 in Haryana against the
              all-India increase of 18,443 during December 2020. In January
              2021, too, the absolute increase in tractor sales in Punjab and
              Haryana was just 1,306 and 1,265 against an all-India increase of
              24,958.

                  Even during the three “conspiracy” months of November
                  2020-January 2021, the total tractor sales of Punjab and
                  Haryana, at 15,670, were only 7 per cent of the corresponding
                  all-India figure of 2,21,924 for the same period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What then explains the spike in tractor sales, on a pan-India
                  basis, from last June? There are three likely reasons.
                </p>

                NHRC notices to four govts, police chiefs over ‘adverse impact’
                of farmers’ protests
              </a>
            </div>
            <p>
              The first is the good monsoons that produced back-to-back bumper
              harvests during the rabi 2020 season (April-June), kharif 2020
              (October-December) and rabi 2021 (April-June). In fact,
              Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry was the only sector that
              achieved a positive growth rate of 3.6% in financial year 2020-21.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second possible reason for the high tractor sales is that all
              agriculture-related activities were exempted from government
              lockdown restrictions, both in the first and second wave of
              Covid-19. Farmers could, therefore, take advantage of the
              excellent monsoon rains to both produce as well as harvest their
              record foodgrain and other crops.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third was government procurement. During the post-lockdown
              period, government agencies bought record/massive quantities of
              not just wheat and paddy, but also cotton, rapeseed-mustard and
              pulses.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, around 433.44 lakh metric tonnes wheat was procured
              for rabi marketing season 2021-22, against 389.93 LMT being
              procured in the previous year, benefiting about 49.20 lakh
              farmers.

            <p>
              All these three factors resulted in higher farm incomes and it is
              likely that the money earned was spent, among other things, on
              buying tractors. And this happened not only in Punjab and Haryana,
              but also other states where there have hardly been any farmer
              protests.

              The TMA data show that after registering a decline in the months
              of March and April in 2020, the sales of tractors picked up from
              May last year, when 60,441 tractors were sold – 4.05% higher than
              58,091 in the same month of 2019. The growth in tractor sales
              across the country continued till April this year when it recorded
              a whopping 436.25% increase – 63,422 in April this year over a low
              base of 11,827 in the same month last year. However, in May this
              year, sales declined by 7.99 per cent. In the following two
              months, June (18.85 per cent) and July (3.25 per cent), the growth
              remained positive but in August (-17.01 per cent), it again
              entered into the negative territory.
